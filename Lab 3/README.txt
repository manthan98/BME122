You'll notice that the .cpp files look much more empty than previous labs. Now that you've gotten the hang of C++ header and source files, it's up to you to implement the method signatures in the .cpp files like in previous labs.

To get the tests working:

 (1) Add main.cpp and Lab3Tests.hpp to your project containing BinarySearchTree.hpp/cpp and PriorityQueue.hpp/cpp (make sure you don't have another main() function in your code; if you do, remove it or comment it out).
     
     (Right click on project in Dev-C++ -> Add to Project)
     
 (2) Run the program in Dev-C++
