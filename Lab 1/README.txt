The files provided are:
  * SequentialList.hpp/.cpp - header and definition file for implementing sequential lists.
  * DoublyLinkedList.hpp/.cpp - header and definition file for implementing doubly linked lists.
  * Lab1Tests.hpp - 6 of 20 tests that we will be running to evaluate your code.
  * main.cpp - main() function that evaluates SequentialList and DoublyLinkedList against the 6 tests in Lab1Tests.

Please complete, in groups, the code in SequentialList.cpp and DoublyLinkedList.cpp, following the comments in SequentialList.hpp and DoublyLinkedList.hpp. We recommend starting with SequentialList, and then progressing to DoublyLinkedList. Refer to the course textbook for more coding details.

To get the tests working:

 (1) Add main.cpp and Lab1Tests.hpp to your project containing DoublyLinkedList.hpp/cpp and SequentialList.hpp/cpp (make sure you don't have another main() function in your code; if you do, remove it or comment it out).
     
     (Right click on project in Dev-C++ -> Add to Project)

 (2) Run the program in Dev-C++
